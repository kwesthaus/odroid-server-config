# odroid-server-config

This repository serves as the single point of change for all important configuration files on my server. I use [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to propagate these changes to their required locations in the filesystem via symlinks as per the .stowrc file in this repository.

See also my [Arch Linux install notes gist](https://gist.github.com/kwesthaus/2819d9dccf7cc314dc3ad7b8b5bddea7) and [config-files repo](https://github.com/kwesthaus/config-files).
